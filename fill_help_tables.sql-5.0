The latter accepts only table_reference, not a list of them\ninside a pair of parentheses.\n\nThis is a conservative extension if we consider each comma in a list of\ntable_reference items as equivalent to an inner join. For example:\n\nSELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2, t3, t4)\n                 ON (t2.a=t1.a AND t3.b=t1.b AND t4.c=t1.c)\n\nis equivalent to :\n\nSELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2 CROSS JOIN t3 CROSS JOIN t4)\n                 ON (t2.a=t1.a AND t3.b=t1.b AND t4.c=t1.c)\n\nIn MySQL, CROSS JOIN is a syntactic equivalent to INNER JOIN (they can\nreplace each other. In standard SQL, they are not equivalent. INNER\nJOIN is used with an ON clause, CROSS JOIN is used otherwise.\n\nIn versions of MySQL prior to 5.0.1, parentheses in table_references\nwere just omitted and all join operations were grouped to the left. In\ngeneral, parentheses can be ignored in join expressions containing only\ninner join operations. As of 5.0.1, nested joins are allowed (see\n[nested-joins]).\n\nFurther changes in join processing were made in 5.0.12 to make MySQL\nmore compliant with standard SQL.

They are saved to\nthe master.info file, but are ignored until you use a server that has\nSSL support enabled.\n\nIf you don't specify a given parameter, it keeps its old value, except\nas indicated in the following discussion. For example, if the password\nto connect to your MySQL master has changed, you just need to issue\nthese statements to tell the slave about the new password:\n\nmysql> STOP SLAVE; -- if replication was running\nmysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_PASSWORD='new3cret';\nmysql> START SLAVE; -- if you want to restart replication\n\nThere is no need to specify the parameters that do not change (host,\nport, user, and so forth).\n\nMASTER_HOST and MASTER_PORT are the hostname (or IP address) of the\nmaster host and its TCP/IP port. Note that if MASTER_HOST is equal to\nlocalhost, then, like in other parts of MySQL, the port may be ignored\n(if Unix socket files can be used, for example).\n\nIf you specify MASTER_HOST or MASTER_PORT, the slave assumes that the\nmaster server is different than before (even if you specify a host or\nport value that is the same as the current value.) In this case, the\nold values for the master binary log name and position are considered\nno longer applicable, so if you do not specify MASTER_LOG_FILE and\nMASTER_LOG_POS in the statement, MASTER_LOG_FILE='' and\nMASTER_LOG_POS=4 are silently appended to it.\n\nMASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are the coordinates at which the\nslave I/O thread should begin reading from the master the next time the\nthread starts. If you specify either of them, you cannot specify\nRELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS. If neither of MASTER_LOG_FILE or\nMASTER_LOG_POS are specified, the slave uses the last coordinates of\nthe slave SQL thread before CHANGE MASTER was issued. This ensures that\nthere is no discontinuity in replication, even if the slave SQL thread\nwas late compared to the slave I/O thread, when you merely want to\nchange, say, the password to use.\n\nCHANGE MASTER deletes all relay log files and starts a new one, unless\nyou specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS. In that case, relay logs\nare kept; the relay_log_purge global variable is set silently to 0.\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO updates the contents of the master.info and\nrelay-log.info files.\n\nCHANGE MASTER is useful for setting up a slave when you have the\nsnapshot of the master and have recorded the log and the offset\ncorresponding to it. After loading the snapshot into the slave, you can\nrun CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='log_name_on_master',\nMASTER_LOG_POS=log_offset_on_master on the slave.\n\nExamples:\n\nmysql> CHANGE MASTER TO\n    ->     MASTER_HOST='master2.mycompany.com',\n    ->     MASTER_USER='replication',\n    ->     MASTER_PASSWORD='bigs3cret',\n    ->     MASTER_PORT=3306,\n    ->     MASTER_LOG_FILE='master2-bin.001',\n    ->     MASTER_LOG_POS=4,\n    ->     MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10;\n\nmysql> CHANGE MASTER TO\n    ->     RELAY_LOG_FILE='slave-relay-bin.006',\n    ->     RELAY_LOG_POS=4025;\n","","change-master-to");

The select_statement is a SELECT statement\nthat provides the definition of the view. The statement can select from\nbase tables or other views.\n\nThis statement requires the CREATE VIEW privilege for the view, and\nsome privilege for each column selected by the SELECT statement. For\ncolumns used elsewhere in the SELECT statement you must have the SELECT\nprivilege. If the OR REPLACE clause is present, you must also have the\nDROP privilege for the view.\n\nA view belongs to a database. By default, a new view is created in the\ncurrent database. To create the view explicitly in a given database,\nspecify the name as db_name.view_name when you create it.\n\nmysql> CREATE VIEW test.v AS SELECT * FROM t;\n\nTables and views share the same namespace within a database, so a\ndatabase cannot contain a table and a view that have the same name.\n\nViews must have unique column names with no duplicates, just like base\ntables. By default, the names of the columns retrieved by the SELECT\nstatement are used for the view column names. To define explicit names\nfor the view columns, the optional column_list clause can be given as a\nlist of comma-separated identifiers. The number of names in column_list\nmust be the same as the number of columns retrieved by the SELECT\nstatement.\n\nColumns retrieved by the SELECT statement can be simple references to\ntable columns. They can also be expressions that use functions,\nconstant values, operators, and so forth.\n\nUnqualified table or view names in the SELECT statement are interpreted\nwith respect to the default database. A view can refer to tables or\nviews in other databases by qualifying the table or view name with the\nproper database name.\n\nA view can be created from many kinds of SELECT statements. It can\nrefer to base tables or other views. It can use joins, UNION, and\nsubqueries. The SELECT need not even refer to any tables. The following\nexample defines a view that selects two columns from another table, as\nwell as an expression calculated from those columns:\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t (qty INT, price INT);\nmysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(3, 50);\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT qty, price, qty*price AS value FROM t;\nmysql> SELECT * FROM v;\n+------+-------+-------+\n| qty  | price | value |\n+------+-------+-------+\n|    3 |    50 |   150 |\n+------+-------+-------+\n\nA view definition is subject to the following restrictions:\n\no The SELECT statement cannot contain a subquery in the FROM clause.\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to system or user variables.\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to prepared statement parameters.\n\no Within a stored routine, the definition cannot refer to routine\n  parameters or local variables.\n\no Any table or view referred to in the definition must exist. However,\n  after a view has been created, it is possible to drop a table or view\n  that the definition refers to. To check a view definition for\n  problems of this kind, use the CHECK TABLE statement.\n\no The definition cannot refer to a TEMPORARY table, and you cannot\n  create a TEMPORARY view.\n\no The tables named in the view definition must already exist.\n\no You cannot associate a trigger with a view.\n\nORDER BY is allowed in a view definition, but it is ignored if you\nselect from a view using a statement that has its own ORDER BY.\n\nFor other options or clauses in the definition, they are added to the\noptions or clauses of the statement that references the view, but the\neffect is undefined. For example, if a view definition includes a LIMIT\nclause, and you select from the view using a statement that has its own\nLIMIT clause, it is undefined which limit applies. This same principle\napplies to options such as ALL, DISTINCT, or SQL_SMALL_RESULT that\nfollow the SELECT keyword, and to clauses such as INTO, FOR UPDATE,\nLOCK IN SHARE MODE, and PROCEDURE.\n\nIf you create a view and then change the query processing environment\nby changing system variables, that may affect the results you get from\nthe view:\n\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT CHARSET(CHAR(65)), COLLATION(CHAR(65));\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SET NAMES 'latin1';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT * FROM v;\n+-------------------+---------------------+\n| CHARSET(CHAR(65)) | COLLATION(CHAR(65)) |\n+-------------------+---------------------+\n| latin1            | latin1_swedish_ci   |\n+-------------------+---------------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SET NAMES 'utf8';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT * FROM v;\n+-------------------+---------------------+\n| CHARSET(CHAR(65)) | COLLATION(CHAR(65)) |\n+-------------------+---------------------+\n| utf8              | utf8_general_ci     |\n+-------------------+---------------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be\nused when checking access privileges at view invocation time. They were\naddded in MySQL 5.0.13, but have no effect until MySQL 5.0.16.\n\nCURRENT_USER also can be given as CURRENT_USER().\n\nWithin a stored routine that is defined with the SQL SECURITY DEFINER\ncharacteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the routine creator. This also\naffects a view defined within such a routine, if the view definition\ncontains a DEFINER value of CURRENT_USER.\n\nThe default DEFINER value is the the user who executes the CREATE VIEW\nstatement. (This is the same as DEFINER = CURRENT_USER.) If a user\nvalue is given, it should be a MySQL account in 'user_name'@'host_name'\nformat (the same format as for the GRANT statement). The user_name and\nhost_name values both are required.\n\nIf you specify the DEFINER clause, you cannot set the value to any user\nbut your own unless you have the SUPER privilege. These rules determine\nthe legal DEFINER user values:\n\no If you do not have the SUPER privilege, the only legal user value is\n  your own account, either specified literally or by using\n  CURRENT_USER. You cannot set the definer to some other account.\n\no If you have the SUPER privilege, you can specify any syntactically\n  legal account name. If the account does not actually exist, a warning\n  is generated.\n\nThe SQL SECURITY characteristic determines which account to use when\nchecking access privileges for the view when the view is executed. The\nlegal characteristic values are DEFINER and INVOKER. These indicate\nthat the view must be executable by the user who defined it or invoked\nit, respectively. The default SQL SECURITY value is DEFINER.\n\nAs of MySQL 5.0.16, view privileges are checked like this:\n\no At view definition time, the view creator must have the privileges\n  needed to use the top-level objects accessed by the view. For\n  example, if the view definition refers to a stored function, only the\n  privileges needed to invoke the function can be checked. The\n  privileges required when the function runs can be checked only as it\n  executes: For different invocations of the function, different\n  execution paths within the function might be taken.\n\no At view execution time, privileges for objects accessed by the view\n  are checked against the privileges held by the view creator or\n  invoker, depending on whether the SQL SECURITY characteristic is\n  DEFINER or INVOKER, respectively.\n\no If view execution causes execution of a stored function, privilege\n  checking for statements executed within the function depend on\n  whether the function is defined with a SQL SECURITY characteristic of\n  DEFINER or INVOKER. If the security characteristic is DEFINER,\n  privileges within the function runs with the privileges of its\n  creator. If the characteristic is INVOKER, the function runs with the\n  privileges determined by the view's SQL SECURITY characteristic.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.0.16 (before the DEFINE and SQL SECURITY clauses were\nimplemented), privileges required for objects used in a view are\nchecked at view creation time.\n\nExample: A view might depend on a stored function, and that function\nmight invoke other stored routines. For example, the following view\ninvokes a stored function f():\n\nCREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t WHERE t.id = f(t.name);\n\nSuppose that f() contains a statement such as this:\n\nIF name IS NULL then\n  CALL p1();\nELSE\n  CALL p2();\nEND IF;\n\nThe privileges required for executing statements within f() need to be\nchecked when f() executes. This might mean that privileges are needed\nfor p1() or p2(), depending on the execution path within f(). Those\nprivileges need to be checked at runtime, and the user who must possess\nthe privileges is determined by the SQL SECURITY values of the function\nf() and the view v.\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses for views are extensions to\nstandard SQL. In standard SQL, views are handled using the rules for\nSQL SECURITY INVOKER.\n\nIf you invoke a view that was created before MySQL 5.0.13, it is\ntreated as though it was created with a SQL SECURITY INVOKER clause and\nwith a DEFINER value that is the same as your account. However, because\nthe actual definer is unknown, MySQL issues a warning. To make the\nwarning go away, it is sufficient to recreate the view so that the view\ndefinition includes a DEFINER clause.\n\nThe optional ALGORITHM clause is a MySQL extension to standard SQL.\nALGORITHM takes three values: MERGE, TEMPTABLE, or UNDEFINED. The\ndefault algorithm is UNDEFINED if no ALGORITHM clause is present. The\nalgorithm affects how MySQL processes the view.\n\nFor MERGE, the text of a statement that refers to the view and the view\ndefinition are merged such that parts of the view definition replace\ncorresponding parts of the statement.\n\nFor TEMPTABLE, the results from the view are retrieved into a temporary\ntable, which then is used to execute the statement.\n\nFor UNDEFINED, MySQL chooses which algorithm to use. It prefers MERGE\nover TEMPTABLE if possible, because MERGE is usually more efficient and\nbecause a view cannot be updatable if a temporary table is used.\n\nA reason to choose TEMPTABLE explicitly is that locks can be released\non underlying tables after the temporary table has been created and\nbefore it is used to finish processing the statement. This might result\nin quicker lock release than the MERGE algorithm so that other clients\nthat use the view are not blocked as long.\n\nA view algorithm can be UNDEFINED three ways:\n\no No ALGORITHM clause is present in the CREATE VIEW statement.\n\no The CREATE VIEW statement has an explicit ALGORITHM = UNDEFINED\n  clause.\n\no ALGORITHM = MERGE is specified for a view that can be processed only\n  with a temporary table. In this case, MySQL generates a warning and\n  sets the algorithm to UNDEFINED.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, MERGE is handled by merging corresponding parts\nof a view definition into the statement that refers to the view. The\nfollowing examples briefly illustrate how the MERGE algorithm works.\nThe examples assume that there is a view v_merge that has this\ndefinition:\n\nCREATE ALGORITHM = MERGE VIEW v_merge (vc1, vc2) AS\nSELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE c3 > 100;\n\nExample 1: Suppose that we issue this statement:\n\nSELECT * FROM v_merge;\n\nMySQL handles the statement as follows:\n\no v_merge becomes t\n\no * becomes vc1, vc2, which corresponds to c1, c2\n\no The view WHERE clause is added\n\nThe resulting statement to be executed becomes:\n\nSELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE c3 > 100;\n\nExample 2: Suppose that we issue this statement:\n\nSELECT * FROM v_merge WHERE vc1 < 100;\n\nThis statement is handled similarly to the previous one, except that\nvc1 < 100 becomes c1 < 100 and the view WHERE clause is added to the\nstatement WHERE clause using an AND connective (and parentheses are\nadded to make sure the parts of the clause are executed with correct\nprecedence). The resulting statement to be executed becomes:\n\nSELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE (c3 > 100) AND (c1 < 100);\n\nEffectively, the statement to be executed has a WHERE clause of this\nform:\n\nWHERE (select WHERE) AND (view WHERE)\n\nThe MERGE algorithm requires a one-to relationship between the rows in\nthe view and the rows in the underlying table. If this relationship\ndoes not hold, a temporary table must be used instead. Lack of a\none-to-one relationship occurs if the view contains any of a number of\nconstructs:\n\no Aggregate functions (SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT(), and so forth)\n\no DISTINCT\n\no GROUP BY\n\no HAVING\n\no UNION or UNION ALL\n\no Refers only to literal values (in this case, there is no underlying\n  table)\n\nSome views are updatable. That is, you can use them in statements such\nas UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT to update the contents of the underlying\ntable. For a view to be updatable, there must be a one-to relationship\nbetween the rows in the view and the rows in the underlying table.\nThere are also certain other constructs that make a view non-updatable.\nTo be more specific, a view is not updatable if it contains any of the\nfollowing:\n\no Aggregate functions (SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT(), and so forth)\n\no DISTINCT\n\no GROUP BY\n\no HAVING\n\no UNION or UNION ALL\n\no Subquery in the select list\n\no Join\n\no Non-updatable view in the FROM clause\n\no A subquery in the WHERE clause that refers to a table in the FROM\n  clause\n\no Refers only to literal values (in this case, there is no underlying\n  table to update)\n\no ALGORITHM = TEMPTABLE (use of a temporary table always makes a view\n  non-updatable)\n\nWith respect to insertability (being updatable with INSERT statements),\nan updatable view is insertable if it also satisfies these additional\nrequirements for the view columns:\n\no There must be no duplicate view column names.\n\no The view must contain all columns in the base table that do not have\n  a default value.\n\no The view columns must be simple column references and not derived\n  columns. A derived column is one that is not a simple column\n  reference but is derived from an expression. These are examples of\n  derived columns:\n\n3.14159\ncol1 + 3\nUPPER(col2)\ncol3 / col4\n(subquery)\n\nA view that has a mix of simple column references and derived columns\nis not insertable, but it can be updatable if you update only those\ncolumns that are not derived. Consider this view:\n\nCREATE VIEW v AS SELECT col1, 1 AS col2 FROM t;\n\nThis view is not insertable because col2 is derived from an expression.\nBut it is updatable if the update does not try to update col2. This\nupdate is allowable:\n\nUPDATE v SET col1 = 0;\n\nThis update is not allowable because it attempts to update a derived\ncolumn:\n\nUPDATE v SET col2 = 0;\n\nIt is sometimes possible for a multiple-table view to be updatable,\nassuming that it can be processed with the MERGE algorithm. For this to\nwork, the view must use an inner join (not an outer join or a UNION).\nAlso, only a single table in the view definition can be updated, so the\nSET clause must name only columns from one of the tables in the view.\nViews that use UNION ALL are disallowed even though they might be\ntheoretically updatable, because the implementation uses temporary\ntables to process them.\n\nFor a multiple-table updatable view, INSERT can work if it inserts into\na single table. DELETE is not supported.\n\nThe WITH CHECK OPTION clause can be given for an updatable view to\nprevent inserts or updates to rows except those for which the WHERE\nclause in the select_statement is true.\n","","create-view");

This is a common problem when you use MySQL\nfor logging and you also periodically run SELECT and UPDATE statements\nthat take a long time to complete.\n\nWhen a client uses INSERT DELAYED, it gets an okay from the server at\nonce, and the row is queued to be inserted when the table is not in use\nby any other thread.\n\nAnother major benefit of using INSERT DELAYED is that inserts from many\nclients are bundled together and written in one block. This is much\nfaster than performing many separate inserts.\n\nThere are some constraints on the use of DELAYED:\n\no INSERT DELAYED works only with MyISAM, MEMORY, and ARCHIVE tables.\n  For MyISAM tables, if there are no free blocks in the middle of the\n  data file, concurrent SELECT and INSERT statements are supported.\n  Under these circumstances, you very seldom need to use INSERT DELAYED\n  with MyISAM. See [myisam-storage-engine], [memory-storage-engine],\n  and [archive-storage-engine].\n\no INSERT DELAYED should be used only for INSERT statements that specify\n  value lists. The server ignores DELAYED for INSERT DELAYED ... SELECT\n  statements.\n\no The server ignores DELAYED for INSERT DELAYED ... ON DUPLICATE UPDATE\n  statements.\n\no Because the statement returns immediately before the rows are\n  inserted, you cannot use LAST_INSERT_ID() to get the AUTO_INCREMENT\n  value which the statement might generate.\n\no DELAYED rows are not visible to SELECT statements until they actually\n  have been inserted.\n\no DELAYED is ignored on slave replication servers because it could\n  cause the slave to have different data than the master.\n","","insert-delayed");
